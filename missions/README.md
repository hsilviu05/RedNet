## üöÄ Using the Mission System

### Starting a Mission
```cpp
#include "missions/Mission.h"

MissionManager missionManager;

// Start a specific mission
if (missionManager.startMission("mission_001")) {
    std::cout << "Mission started successfully!" << std::endl;
}
```

### Checking Mission Progress
```cpp
auto* currentMission = missionManager.getCurrentMission();
if (currentMission) {
    int progress = missionManager.getMissionProgress();
    int score = missionManager.getTotalScore();
    
    std::cout << "Progress: " << progress << "%" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Score: " << score << "/" << currentMission->totalPoints << std::endl;
}
```

### Completing Objectives
```cpp
// Complete an objective
if (missionManager.completeObjective("obj_001_scan_network")) {
    std::cout << "Objective completed!" << std::endl;
}

// Check if mission is complete
if (missionManager.isMissionCompleted()) {
    std::cout << "Mission completed!" << std::endl;
}
```

### Getting Available Missions
```cpp
auto missions = missionManager.getAvailableMissions();
for (const auto& mission : missions) {
    std::cout << "Mission: " << mission.name << " [" << mission.difficulty << "]" << std::endl;
}
```
